          <h3>Notes on the Never-Ending Snail Breeding Project</h3>
          <p>
            This reflection examines the first six years of a lifelong
            practice caring for and breeding common garden snails,
            <em>Cornu aspersum</em>. Given this project's inchoate status, any
            written account is necessarily provisional. Accordingly, this text
            moves between factual summary and diaristic contemplation while
            embracing detours from the project’s stated intent along the way.
            The easiest title, Snail Breeding Project, is replaced by
            Never-Ending Snail Breeding Project for this text but there is no
            fixed title. I’m optimistic that another title will come.
          </p>
          <h3>Precursor</h3>
          <p>
            Prior to the introduction of the snails were two relevant
            interactions with exotic pets, which I will describe here. In late
            2018, during my final year of college, I purchased a Giant
            Vietnamese centipede, <em>Scolopendra subspinipes</em>, through an
            online retailer. The animal was never named and its presence in my
            studio felt physically threatening bordering on regrettable. I
            can’t stress enough the speed it possessed–I worried it might
            escape during a feeding, disappearing in the pipes until a
            studiomate received an excruciating and potentially lethal bite. I
            wore thick leather construction gloves and used stainless-steel
            aquarium tweezers to manipulate the fluffy coconut-husk substrate
            the centipede would burrow into.
          </p>
          <p>
            On two occasions, the centipede was fed under questionable
            circumstances. Twice I sourced green anoles from a pet supply
            store in Elyria. The manager had me sign a document each time
            agreeing that the anoles would not be used to feed another animal.
            Within hours of each feeding, the centipede would leave a
            perfectly intact anole skeleton. One of these skeletons was
            mounted on a painting with cyanoacrylate glue. On one occasion,
            the centipede itself was featured in a student exhibition in front
            of a tree I had cut down, placed in a clear lidless paint can on a
            stool for observation by attendees. The maintenance and care of
            the centipede began to eclipse any other purpose I had for it in a
            way I did not yet fully understand. Much of this period consisted
            in observation. At times it felt like staring into a black hole.
            On a winter trip back home to Los Angeles, the centipede died on
            the plane, marking an abrupt end to this particular exploration.
          </p>
          <p>
            After this period with the centipede, I moved back in with my
            parents and prepared to buy a hatchling green anaconda,
            <em>Eunectes murinus</em>, from an anaconda breeder I had been
            following online named Meghan Kelley. Meghan came to my attention
            via a breeding project I was particularly interested in at the
            time, the Reach Out Reptiles super dwarf reticulated python
            project, which seeked to create a chihuahua-like, miniature
            version of the world’s longest snake species. This breeder had
            collected a few of her anacondas. I put down the deposit and
            purchased necessary starting materials: heat pads, a bespoke
            drawer-like snake enclosure, lighting, troughs. There was an
            exotic pet exposition in Anaheim, CA where we planned the pickup.
            My priority in owning the snake was the creation of a sculpture
            using a non-functional but water-filled toilet with a complete
            female green anaconda defecation inside of it. This would be
            installed near the far wall of a space, with the other walls
            hosting mounted live baby snake containers of various morphs
            paired with customized Starbucks drinks. An example pairing: tall
            Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew with no ice, extra foam, and an extra shot
            of espresso with a baby rainbow boa, <em>Epicrates cenchria</em>,
            expressing an incomplete dominant Picasso Stripe gene. The sex
            specificity of the green anaconda put more pressure on things, as
            the females are significantly larger than the males. The ten year
            logistical nightmare of owning the giant snake was supposed to
            ‘figure itself out.’ On the freeway to Anaheim to pick up my
            selected anaconda, I texted the breeder that I was no longer
            interested, giving up my deposit and shelving the project.
          </p>
          <h3>Snails</h3>
          <p>
            Abandoning the anaconda coincided with the unplanned acquisition
            of the basal population of Never-Ending Snail Breeding Project
            garden snails. I removed nine snails from a friend’s backyard in
            Encino, which his parents had just begun to treat with poison. The
            decision was made after an extended period spent with them in one
            large planter, flipping over leaves revealing tens of snails of
            different sizes and stages of their life cycle, incredibly small,
            small, medium, extra large. A snail is the kind of animal you see
            just sparingly enough for it to deliver surprise when given a
            second glance–on this night in particular I was very overtaken by
            my impression of the garden snail as an animal species. They
            attracted infinite gazing. I was trying to move away from milking
            artworks from these animals I was buying and focus more on their
            care and continued existence in my life, a struggle that has
            remained unresolved. Not realizing what was to come, I took their
            scheduled demise as a sign and left his house that night with the
            snails in tow. The project began.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few things about the snails captivated me. They move faster than
            their proverbial pace suggests–remarkably fast for their mode of
            locomotion. These snails’ shells were almost indistinguishable
            prima facie–I could pick out the darkest and lightest shells,
            maybe a shell that had been cracked and healed, but that was it.
            My first impulse was to train my eye to notice more subtle
            differences between snail shells, but in subsequent years the
            shells have had unexpected emergent properties. These will be
            touched on shortly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Snail digestion has outlasted some of these other qualities as a
            primary fascination. Snails and other gastropods consume their
            food with an organ called a radula, covered in tooth-like
            structures that scrape off flecks of food and move them to the
            esophagus. While their method of digestion resembles that of most
            animals, snails uniquely produce cellulases to break down plant
            matter. Though still a subject of debate, snails seem to produce
            these enzymes themselves rather than employ gut flora, as snail
            guts mostly contain microorganisms already present in the soil, if
            any. I was taken by this detail, and inspection of the snail
            defecation showed something else unique. Vegetal matter is
            minimally altered–scraped flecks are held together in transparent
            mucus, highlighting the original pigmentation of the food. Their
            defecation resembled paint out of the tube.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was clear in the first few days that these snails were the
            point of convergence for several interests and strategies I was
            exploring during this period. I sensed this would be a life-long
            engagement, and that this resembled the point. Bonsai had grown as
            one of these parallel interests. Yamadori in particular, which
            involves the pulling of a naturally crippled tree from a
            mountainside or similar terrain to use as a bonsai starter, felt
            nearly identical to the project I had set out on. Bonsai regularly
            outlive their owners, who pass their trees down for generations. I
            tried and failed to establish a yamadori sugar pine during this
            time. The snail project was in part modeled after this tradition:
            maintaining an unbroken generational lineage of snails to be cared
            for indefinitely.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result of the project’s immense scale, I’ve time and time
            again contradicted some of my most basic feelings about how the
            Never-Ending Snail Breeding Project is related to art, on occasion
            felt that it had nothing to do with art, and with some frequency
            wondered what exactly I was doing. In 2020, TikTok became a
            central venue for publicly sharing the snails as snail defecation
            became a primary material produced in overwhelming volume by the
            project. The action of applying this substance to canvases, paper,
            and sculpture using my fingers was recorded in 15-30 second
            videos. A few of these videos still exist. As previously
            mentioned, the colorful defecation mystified me. Since the
            beginning, the snails have had a primary diet of dark leafy greens
            like collards, kale, and carrots along with the usual supplement
            of cuttlefish “bone”. These foods produce a deep green and radiant
            orange in the defecation. The orange pigment in particular fades
            within days of drying out. No effort was made to prevent the
            deterioration of these pigments. Both direct artistic practice and
            indirect promotion, this profile building on TikTok and other
            platforms may have briefly contributed to the project's
            visibility, though the people paying attention had no context to
            understand that this was a project in the first place.
            Concurrently, a practice of naming and photographing individual
            snails emerged as part of a broader attempt to recognize and
            document subtle variations, including an archive of shell
            measurements taken with a caliper. This practice was eventually
            dropped along with digital and physical attempts at rendering
            portraits to record the detail of my observation. The
            identification of unique traits amongst the snails has waned
            almost completely from the project by now, but will reenter moving
            forward. Pairings of orange and green persist as a motif of the
            project, along with use of snail defecation.

          <p>
            Snails reproduce frequently, laying between 40-80 eggs beneath the
            soil. Allowing this cycle to go on unchecked would plummet the
            quality of life of any snail owner’s project. As a result, most
            snail hobbyists are forced to cull, or selectively slaughter, the
            snail offspring. This is usually an opportunity to select certain
            traits and reject others, such as color, size, and general
            capacity to stay alive. Due to the unusual circumstances of the
            Never-Ending Snail Breeding Project, I have never been sure what
            exactly to actively select for. Slaughtering countless baby snails
            is my reality, and I usually achieve this by throwing them out my
            window. My tendency is to let more than I should survive, that is
            if I’ve let the snails hatch. At times there are multiple egg
            clutches visible beneath the soil, which gives me an opportunity
            to randomly select one to destroy. On multiple occasions I’ve
            tasted this snail caviar, milky pearlescent eggs that, once
            cleaned of any dirt, taste earthy and rich. Some friends have
            suggested snail farming specifically for caviar should be one of
            the aims of the project, but I don’t have the space or really the
            desire to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further layers of meaning accumulated as I realized the snails
            were storing physical records of their care and neglect within
            their shells. Analogous to geological strata or ice core samples,
            each shell offers a material archive containing potentially
            interpretable information about the state of contemporary art
            practice at large and the personal habits of myself as their
            caretaker. These habits have swung in the direction of neglect for
            extended periods. In 2021, while on an international tour as part
            of the Whistlegraph artist group, the snails survived in my studio
            for a month without care. But the evidence of my neglect was
            obvious and permanent for this population, with almost every
            still-developing snail exhibiting at least one growth line of
            neglect. Many snails have died, and I’ve taken care to preserve
            their shells. This has felt less important more recently–some of
            these shells have been used as painting supports in and of
            themselves, painted to resemble simple chameleon heads or in a
            monochrome brown. I’m confused by these snail-induced artworks,
            and feel that acknowledging them here may give them unwarranted
            attention. But this is a marathon, not a sprint, and these are the
            realities of the project.
          </p>
          <p>
            A brief image that explains my mindset during this time, roughly
            2020-2022. My primary focus was the daily practice with my
            collaborators in Whistlegraph, which pulled attention away from
            the snails. As a result of this new responsibility, the snails
            frequently took the backseat. A reoccuring dream during this time
            involved encountering vast towers of terrariums, dirty and
            stinking, abandoned for what seemed like years in awful, dark
            rooms. To my horror, as I’d peer into these terrariums, the small
            animals inside were somehow still, just barely, alive.
          </p>
          <h3>Alien Hybrid Monsters</h3>
          <p>
            Within the first year with the snails, the project projected a far
            horizon of biological speculation. I am nurturing the potential
            for genetic transformation through selective breeding and
            neglectful care, with the goal of hybridizing these snails with
            other mollusk species, particularly cephalopods like cuttlefish,
            aiming to produce a new, intelligent mosaic life form capable of
            novel forms of interspecies communication. Additions of other
            genetic materials, extraterrestrial or not, are welcome depending
            on what discoveries are made over the next million years. This is
            the farthest reaching vision for what this project could realize.
            Initially framed as an “ambient mutation tank”, casually
            irradiating the snails with ionizing waves from bananas and cosmic
            rays, I’ve doubled down on the project's mutative aims. During two
            public presentations of the snails at the San Francisco Art Book
            Fair and Decentralized Web Camp, the slow mutation of the lineage
            in my studio felt sufficiently teased out. But after these
            lectures, the hybridizing and creation of a novel animal became
            the focus of all changes within the genome I was nurturing. Around
            this period, the project resembled an unfundable analogue
            artificial intelligence startup with only a vague utility in mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            This hybrid monster would exhibit a unique intelligence enabling
            communication in a novel way when measured against all current
            human to non-human communications. The evolutionary gap between
            vertebrates and invertebrates would be bridged through these
            charismatic new invertebrate representatives. I do believe in the
            creative transformation of life itself, not towards a Caligarian
            anthropomorphization of everything but towards a fundamental
            desire for an increase in difference and complexity. Not in the
            creation of, to use a contemporary example, a hyper-productive AI
            limited by our knowledge until it naturally escapes that, but a
            creation with that escape as the aim. An actively collaborative,
            mutualistic symbiosis. I may be too attached to the monstrous
            description, as I don’t imagine nor desire this species to be a
            disharmonic chimera.I prefer not to imprison this creature within
            the limits of my imagination. I’m trying to respect morphological
            designs I could never fully grasp in their emergence–to allow them
            to express themselves. When I use the term monster, I am borrowing
            that term to describe the products of a truly creative and
            courageous play with the materials of life itself. If the snails
            are to be this path towards creating a new form of life through
            contemporary methods, they will likely require the efforts and
            funds of multiple parties. But making the poetic case comes first.
          </p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            My lifetime with the snails will not coincide with the artwork the
            project seeks to realize. Even if that artwork is the alien hybrid
            monster, only over magaanums, if this lineage of snails remains
            unbroken through speciation or hybridization, would a point or
            points along this population’s evolutionary gradient become
            self-evident as an artwork. By this far future point, even within
            10,000 years, “art” may be an extinct term. Our own species will
            have transformed into something else. It becomes unimaginable,
            beyond speculation. But the most crucial qualities of art will
            surely persist, its extra-dimensional qualities perceptible by an
            audience we don’t have words to describe. Whatever it is that
            replaces art might ring at the same frequency we’ve come to
            associate with what’s best about art. I must stress that this
            recurring vision is as susceptible to transformation as the
            genetic information of the snails themselves during the life of
            this project. Had I written this a year or two ago, I would have
            insisted I had no clear agenda in sight. This project will exist
            for so long that it will outlive the many things I’ve thought
            about it over the years, including what I may think is its
            critical purchase in this text. Choosing a goal is as easy as
            writing it down, but more than anything just keeping these snails
            alive is what concerns me most. Another goal will likely reveal
            itself in time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m in my sixth year of breeding these snails over what is now
            surely the 13th 14th 15th 16th(?) generation. Their rapid
            reproduction means a few months of relative detachment from the
            project can confuse generation counting. There are still times I
            walk into my studio and expect them all to be dead. I am a
            terrible snail owner. There are periods of boredom with the
            project followed by focused observation and maintenance. The
            snails have moved between California, Oregon, and New York. When
            preparing to move them to New York, I decreased the population by
            tossing many of the snails in gardens and yards in my Los Angeles
            neighborhood as a sort of insurance in the event of a total
            die-off. I’d like to think that any snail I find in those yards
            contains some genetic continuity with the original lineage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Improvements can be made. By this point the rampant incest must
            be curtailed. I’m considering the introduction of one or two
            individuals from outside the project to increase genetic
            diversity. Simultaneously, forking off specifically selected
            couples in reproduction tanks would begin the process of selecting
            for specific traits. These traits need only to be determined for
            reasons somewhat arbitrary (shell color, shape, and pattern) or
            better suited for survival in the project (shell thickness, snail
            size). I’d like to provide the snails with more space in the
            coming years. Close quarters can decrease snail activity due to
            constant interaction with one another’s mucus trails. The plan is
            to design a circular dish about the size of a washing machine
            window or larger in which a mound of clay-abundant, sand-heavy
            soil and rock can be sculpted, with a breeding mote of softer
            substrate around the perimeter. A large acrylic cloche with a
            handle can be used to cover this mound.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, while extensive textual reflections and conceptual
            tangents remain secondary to the central breeding and care
            practice, they serve an essential role in maintaining the
            project's visibility and interest over potentially vast
            timescales. These written records may prove crucial in securing
            future engagement and funding, ensuring the project's continuity
            and its potential transformation across generations. There is a
            possibility of this.
