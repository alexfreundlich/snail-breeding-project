          <h3><b>Notes on the Never‑Ending Snail Breeding Project</b></h3>
          <p>
            This reflection examines the first six years of a lifelong practice
            caring for and breeding common garden snails,
            <em>Cornu aspersum</em>. Given this project's inchoate status, any
            written account is necessarily provisional. Accordingly, this text
            moves between factual summary and diaristic contemplation while
            embracing detours from the project’s stated intent along the way.
            The easiest title, <em>Snail Breeding Project</em>, is replaced by
            <em>Never‑Ending Snail Breeding Project</em> for this text but there
            is no fixed title. I’m optimistic that another title will come.
          </p>
          <h3><b>Precursor</b></h3>
          <p>
            Prior to the introduction of the snails were two relevant
            interactions with exotic pets, which I will describe here. In late
            2018, during my final year of college, I purchased a Giant
            Vietnamese centipede, <em>Scolopendra subspinipes</em>, through an
            online retailer. The animal was never named and its presence in my
            studio felt physically threatening bordering on regrettable. I can’t
            stress enough the speed it possessed–I worried it might escape
            during a feeding, disappearing in the pipes until a studiomate
            received an excruciating and potentially lethal bite. I wore thick
            leather construction gloves and used stainless-steel aquarium
            tweezers to manipulate the fluffy coconut-husk substrate the
            centipede would burrow into.
          </p>
          <p>
            On two occasions the centipede was fed under questionable
            circumstances. I sourced green anoles from a pet supply store in
            Elyria. The manager had me sign a document agreeing that the anoles
            would not be used to feed another animal. Within hours of feeding,
            the centipede would leave a perfectly intact anole skeleton. On one
            occasion, the centipede was featured in a student exhibition, placed
            in a clear paint can on a stool for observation by attendees. The
            maintenance and care of the centipede began to eclipse any ephemera
            related to it in a way I did not yet fully understand. Much of this
            period consisted in observation. At times it felt like staring into
            a black hole. On a winter trip back home to Los Angeles, the
            centipede died on the plane, marking an abrupt end to this
            particular exploration.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the centipede I moved back in with my parents and prepared to
            buy a hatchling green anaconda, <em>Eunectes murinus</em>, from an
            anaconda breeder I had been following online named Meghan Kelley. I
            put down the deposit and purchased necessary starting materials.
            There was an exotic pet exposition in Anaheim, CA where we planned
            the pickup. My priority in owning the snake was creating a sculpture
            consisting of a non-functional toilet filled with water and a
            complete female green anaconda defecation inside of it. This would
            be installed near the far wall of a space, with the other walls
            hosting mounted live baby snake containers of various morphs paired
            with customized Starbucks drinks. An example pairing: tall Pumpkin
            Cream Cold Brew with no ice, extra foam, and an extra shot of
            espresso with a rainbow boa, <em>Epicrates cenchria</em>, expressing
            an incomplete dominant Picasso Stripe gene. The sex specificity of
            the green anaconda put more pressure on things, as the females are
            significantly larger than the males. The ten year logistical
            nightmare of owning the giant snake was supposed to ‘figure itself
            out.’ On the freeway to Anaheim to pick up my selected anaconda, I
            texted the breeder that I was no longer interested, giving up my
            deposit and shelving the project.
          </p>
          <h3><b>Snails</b></h3>
          <p>
            Abandoning the anaconda coincided with the unexpected acquisition of
            garden snails. Nine snails were removed from a friend’s backyard in
            Encino, which his parents had just begun to treat with poison. The
            decision was made after an extended period spent with them in one
            large planter, flipping over leaves revealing tens of snails of
            different sizes and stages of their life cycle, incredibly small,
            small, medium, extra large. The whole encounter had this feeling of
            reunion–a snail is the kind of animal you see just sparingly enough
            for it to deliver surprise when given a second glance–and on this
            night in particular I was very overtaken by my impression of the
            garden snail as an animal species. Leaving his house that night with
            the snails in tow, the project began.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few things about the snails captivated me. They move faster than
            their reputation suggests–remarkably fast for their mode of
            locomotion. These snails’ shells were almost indistinguishable prima
            facie–I could pick out the darkest and lightest shells, maybe a
            shell that had been cracked and healed, but that was it. My first
            impulse was to train my eye to notice more subtle differences
            between snail shells (the shells have had more to offer as the
            project progresses). Snail digestion has outlasted the others as a
            primary fascination. Snails and other gastropods consume their food
            with an organ called a radula, covered in tooth-like structures that
            scrape off flecks of food and move them to the esophagus. While
            their method of digestion resembles that of most animals, snails
            uniquely produce cellulases to break down plant matter. Though still
            a subject of debate, snails seem to produce these enzymes themselves
            rather than employ gut flora, as snail guts mostly contain
            microorganisms already present in the soil, if any. I was taken by
            this detail, and inspection of the snail defecation showed something
            else unique. Vegetal matter is minimally altered–scraped flecks are
            held together in a tube of mucus highlighting the original
            pigmentation of the food. Their defecation resembled paint out of
            the tube.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was clear in the first few days that these snails were the point
            of convergence for several interests and strategies that had been
            overtaking me during this period. I sensed this would be a life-long
            engagement. Bonsai had grown as one of these parallel interests.
            Yamadori in particular, which involves the pulling of a naturally
            crippled tree from a mountainside or similar terrain to use as a
            bonsai starter, felt uncannily similar to the project I had set out
            on. Bonsai regularly outlive their owners, who pass their trees down
            for generations. The snail project was in part modeled after this
            tradition: maintaining an unbroken generational lineage of snails to
            be cared for indefinitely.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result of the project’s immense scale, experiments and ephemera
            have come and gone to help pass the time despite possibly
            contradicting some of my most basic feelings about how Never-Ending
            Snail Breeding Project is related to art. In 2020, TikTok became a
            venue for publicly sharing the snails as snail defecation became a
            primary material produced in overwhelming volume by the project. The
            action of applying this substance to canvases, paper, and sculptures
            using my fingers was recorded in 15-30 second videos. A few of these
            videos still exist. As previously mentioned, the colorful defecation
            mystified me. Since the beginning, the snails have had a primary
            diet of dark leafy greens like collards, kale, and carrots along
            with the usual supplement of cuttlefish “bone”. These foods produce
            a deep green and radiant orange in the defecation. The orange
            pigment in particular fades within days of drying out. No effort was
            made to seal these snail defecation works. Both direct artistic
            practice and indirect promotion, this profile work briefly
            contributed to the project's visibility. Concurrently, a practice of
            naming and photographing individual snails emerged as part of a
            broader attempt to recognize and document subtle variations, but was
            eventually dropped along with digital and physical attempts at
            rendering portraits to record the detail of my observation. Pairings
            of orange and green persist as a motif of the project, along with
            use of snail defecation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further layers of meaning accumulated as the snails began storing
            physical records of their care and neglect within their shells.
            Analogous to geological strata or ice core samples, these shells
            offered material archives potentially interpretable as reflections
            of contemporary art practice and the personal habits of myself as an
            artist. And these habits swung in the direction of neglect for
            extended periods. In 2021, while on a month-long international tour
            as part of the Whistlegraph artist group, the snails survived in my
            studio without care. But the evidence of my neglect was obvious and
            permanent, with almost every snail exhibiting at least one line of
            neglect early on in their shell formation. This was a marathon, not
            a sprint.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ll briefly mention my mindset during this time, roughly 2020-2022.
            My primary focus was the daily practice with my collaborators in
            Whistlegraph, which pulled attention away from the snails. As a
            result of this new responsibility, the project entered its first
            extended period of neglect. A reoccuring dream during this time
            involved encountering vast towers of terrariums, dirty and stinking,
            abandoned for what seemed like years. To my horror, as I’d peer into
            these terrariums, the small animals inside were somehow still
            clinging to life.
          </p>
          <h3><b>Alien Hybrid Monsters</b></h3>
          <p>
            From the outset, the project has projected a far horizon of
            biological speculation. I am nurturing the potential for genetic
            transformation through selective breeding and neglectful care, with
            the goal of hybridizing these snails with other mollusk species,
            particularly cephalopods, aiming to produce a new, intelligent
            mosaic life form capable of novel forms of interspecies
            communication. Initially framed as an ambient mutation tank,
            casually irradiating the snails with ionizing waves from bananas and
            cosmic rays, the project's goals have since expanded. Through public
            presentations at San Francisco Art Book Fair and Decentralized Web
            Camp, the more monstrous ends of the project were teased out. These
            presentations emphasized the speculative and utopian potentials
            rather than practical or ethical limitations, positioning the
            project as a persistent and provocative suggestion to future
            generations. Around this period, the project resembled an unfunded
            analogue artificial intelligence startup.
          </p>
          <p>
            The snails are a path towards creating a new form of life through
            contemporary methods likely requiring the efforts and funds of
            multiple parties. This hybrid monster will exhibit a unique
            intelligence enabling communication in a novel way when measured
            against all current human to non-human communications. The
            evolutionary gap between vertebrates and invertebrates would be
            bridged through these charismatic new invertebrate representatives.
            I believe in the creative transformation of life itself, not towards
            a Caligarian anthropomorphization of everything but towards a
            fundamental desire for an increase in difference and complexity. Not
            the creation of a hyper-productive AI limited by our knowledge until
            it naturally escapes that, but a creation with escape as the aim.
            The workplace hazard of such an undertaking may in theory be the
            creation of a bioweapon but I’m sure that won't happen. I believe
            the time is now to start creating new life forms. My snails are
            aliens in the making.
          </p>
          <h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
          <p>
            My lifetime with the snails will not coincide with the artwork the
            project seeks to realize. Only over magaanums, if this lineage of
            snails remains unbroken through speciation or hybridization, then
            there will be a point along that gradient that would be the artwork.
            My intent is that a point or points along this population’s
            evolutionary gradient would become self-evident as an artwork. By
            this far future point, even within 10,000 years, “art” may be an
            extinct term. Our own species will have transformed into something
            else. It becomes unimaginable, beyond speculation. But the most
            crucial qualities of art will surely persist, its extra-dimensional
            qualities perceptible by an audience we don’t have words to
            describe. Whatever it is that replaces art might ring at the same
            frequency we’ve come to associate with what’s best about art. I must
            stress that this recurring vision is as susceptible to
            transformation as the genetic information of the snails themselves
            during the life of this project. Had I written this a year or two
            ago, I might have insisted this project had no clear agenda in
            sight. Choosing a goal is as easy as writing it down, but more than
            anything just keeping these snails alive is what concerns me most.
            Another goal may reveal itself in time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m in my sixth year of breeding these snails over what is now
            surely the 13th 14th 15th 16th(?) generation. They reproduce so
            rapidly that a few months of detachment from the project can confuse
            generation counting. There are still times I walk into my studio and
            expect them all to be dead. I am a terrible snail owner. There are
            periods of boredom with the project followed by focused observation
            and maintenance. Ultimately, while extensive textual reflections and
            conceptual tangents remain secondary to the central breeding and
            care practice, they serve an essential role in maintaining the
            project's visibility and interest over potentially vast timescales.
            These written records may prove crucial in securing future
            engagement and funding, ensuring the project's continuity and its
            potential transformation across generations. There is a possibility
            of this.
