        <h3>Notes on the Never-Ending Snail Breeding Project</h3>
        <p>
          This reflection examines the first six years of a lifelong
          practice caring for and breeding common garden snails,
          <em>Cornu aspersum</em>. Given this project's inchoate status, any
          written account is necessarily provisional. Accordingly, this text
          moves between factual summary and diaristic contemplation while
          embracing detours from the project’s stated intent along the way.
          The easiest title, Snail Breeding Project, is replaced by
          Never-Ending Snail Breeding Project for this text but there is no
          fixed title. I’m optimistic that another title will come.
        </p>
        <h3>Precursor</h3>
        <p>
          Prior to the introduction of the snails were two relevant
          interactions with exotic pets, which I will describe here. In late
          2018, during my final year of college, I purchased a Giant
          Vietnamese centipede, <em>Scolopendra subspinipes</em>, through an
          online retailer. The animal was never named and its presence in my
          studio felt physically threatening bordering on regrettable. I
          can’t stress enough the speed it possessed–I worried it might
          escape during a feeding, disappearing in the pipes until a
          studiomate received an excruciating and potentially lethal bite. I
          wore thick leather construction gloves and used stainless-steel
          aquarium tweezers to manipulate the fluffy coconut-husk substrate
          the centipede would burrow into.
        </p>
        <p>
          On two occasions, the centipede was fed under questionable
          circumstances. Twice I sourced green anoles from a pet supply
          store in Elyria. The manager had me sign a document each time
          agreeing that the anoles would not be used to feed another animal.
          Within hours of each feeding, the centipede would leave a
          perfectly intact anole skeleton. One of these skeletons was
          mounted on a painting with cyanoacrylate glue. On one occasion,
          the centipede itself was featured in a student exhibition in front
          of a tree I had cut down, placed in a clear lidless paint can on a
          stool for observation by attendees. The maintenance and care of
          the centipede began to eclipse any other purpose I had for it in a
          way I did not yet fully understand. Much of this period consisted
          in observation. At times it felt like staring into a black hole.
          On a winter trip back home to Los Angeles, the centipede died on
          the plane, marking an abrupt end to this particular exploration.
        </p>
        <p>
          After this period with the centipede, I moved back in with my
          parents and prepared to buy a hatchling green anaconda,
          <em>Eunectes murinus</em>, from an anaconda breeder I had been
          following online named Meghan Kelley. Meghan came to my attention
          via a breeding project I was particularly interested in at the
          time, the Reach Out Reptiles super dwarf reticulated python
          project, which seeked to create a chihuahua-like, miniature
          version of the world’s longest snake species. This breeder had
          collected a few of her anacondas. I put down the deposit and
          purchased necessary starting materials: heat pads, a bespoke
          drawer-like snake enclosure, lighting, troughs. There was an
          exotic pet exposition in Anaheim, CA where we planned the pickup.
          My priority in owning the snake was the creation of a sculpture
          using a non-functional but water-filled toilet with a complete
          female green anaconda defecation inside of it. This would be
          installed near the far wall of a space, with the other walls
          hosting mounted live baby snake containers of various morphs
          paired with customized Starbucks drinks. An example pairing: tall
          Pumpkin Cream Cold Brew with no ice, extra foam, and an extra shot
          of espresso with a baby rainbow boa, <em>Epicrates cenchria</em>,
          expressing an incomplete dominant Picasso Stripe gene. The sex
          specificity of the green anaconda put more pressure on things, as
          the females are significantly larger than the males. The ten year
          logistical nightmare of owning the giant snake was supposed to
          ‘figure itself out.’ On the freeway to Anaheim to pick up my
          selected anaconda, I texted the breeder that I was no longer
          interested, giving up my deposit and shelving the project.
        </p>
        <h3>Snails</h3>
        <p>
          Abandoning the anaconda coincided with the unplanned acquisition
          of the basal population of Never-Ending Snail Breeding Project
          garden snails. I removed nine snails from a friend’s backyard in
          Encino, which his parents had just begun to treat with poison. The
          decision was made after an extended period spent with them in one
          large planter, flipping over leaves revealing tens of snails of
          different sizes and stages of their life cycle, incredibly small,
          small, medium, extra large. A snail is the kind of animal you see
          just sparingly enough for it to deliver surprise when given a
          second glance–on this night in particular I was very overtaken by
          my impression of the garden snail as an animal species. They
          attracted infinite gazing. I was trying to move away from milking
          artworks from these animals I was buying and focus more on their
          care and continued existence in my life, a struggle that has
          remained unresolved. Not realizing what was to come, I took their
          scheduled demise as a sign and left his house that night with the
          snails in tow. The project began.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few things about the snails captivated me. They move faster than
          their proverbial pace suggests–remarkably fast for their mode of
          locomotion. These snails’ shells were almost indistinguishable
          prima facie–I could pick out the darkest and lightest shells,
          maybe a shell that had been cracked and healed, but that was it.
          My first impulse was to train my eye to notice more subtle
          differences between snail shells, but in subsequent years the
          shells have had unexpected emergent properties. These will be
          touched on shortly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Snail digestion has outlasted some of these other qualities as a
          primary fascination. Snails and other gastropods consume their
          food with an organ called a radula, covered in tooth-like
          structures that scrape off flecks of food and move them to the
          esophagus. While their method of digestion resembles that of most
          animals, snails uniquely produce cellulases to break down plant
          matter. Though still a subject of debate, snails seem to produce
          these enzymes themselves rather than employ gut flora, as snail
          guts mostly contain microorganisms already present in the soil, if
          any. I was taken by this detail, and inspection of the snail
          defecation showed something else unique. Vegetal matter is
          minimally altered–scraped flecks are held together in transparent
          mucus, highlighting the original pigmentation of the food. Their
          defecation resembled paint out of the tube.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was clear in the first few days that these snails were the
          point of convergence for several interests and strategies I was
          exploring during this period. I sensed this would be a life-long
          engagement, and that this resembled the point. Bonsai had grown as
          one of these parallel interests. Yamadori in particular, which
          involves the pulling of a naturally crippled tree from a
          mountainside or similar terrain to use as a bonsai starter, felt
          nearly identical to the project I had set out on. Bonsai regularly
          outlive their owners, who pass their trees down for generations. I
          tried and failed to establish a yamadori sugar pine during this
          time. The snail project was in part modeled after this tradition:
          maintaining an unbroken generational lineage of snails to be cared
          for indefinitely.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result of the project’s immense scale, I’ve time and time
          again contradicted some of my most basic feelings about how the
          Never-Ending Snail Breeding Project is related to art, on occasion
          felt that it had nothing to do with art, and with some frequency
          wondered what exactly I was doing. In 2020, TikTok became a
          central venue for publicly sharing the snails as snail defecation
          became a primary material produced in overwhelming volume by the
          project. The action of applying this substance to canvases, paper,
          and sculpture using my fingers was recorded in 15-30 second
          videos. A few of these videos still exist. As previously
          mentioned, the colorful defecation mystified me. Since the
          beginning, the snails have had a primary diet of dark leafy greens
          like collards, kale, and carrots along with the usual supplement
          of cuttlefish “bone”. These foods produce a deep green and radiant
          orange in the defecation. The orange pigment in particular fades
          within days of drying out. No effort was made to prevent the
          deterioration of these pigments. Both direct artistic practice and
          indirect promotion, this profile building on TikTok and other
          platforms may have briefly contributed to the project's
          visibility, though the people paying attention had no context to
          understand that this was a project in the first place.
          Concurrently, a practice of naming and photographing individual
          snails emerged as part of a broader attempt to recognize and
          document subtle variations, including an archive of shell
          measurements taken with a caliper. This practice was eventually
          dropped along with digital and physical attempts at rendering
          portraits to record the detail of my observation. The
          identification of unique traits amongst the snails has waned
          almost completely from the project by now, but will reenter moving
          forward. Pairings of orange and green persist as a motif of the
          project, along with use of snail defecation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Snails reproduce frequently, laying between 40-80 eggs beneath the
          soil. Allowing this cycle to go on unchecked would plummet the
          quality of life of any snail owner’s project. As a result, most
          snail hobbyists are forced to cull, or selectively slaughter, the
          snail offspring. This is usually an opportunity to select certain
          traits and reject others, such as color, size, and general
          capacity to stay alive. Due to the unusual circumstances of the
          Never-Ending Snail Breeding Project, I have never been sure what
          exactly to actively select for. Slaughtering countless baby snails
          is my reality, and I usually achieve this by throwing them out my
          window. My tendency is to let more than I should survive, that is
          if I’ve let the snails hatch. At times there are multiple egg
          clutches visible beneath the soil, which gives me an opportunity
          to randomly select one to destroy. On multiple occasions I’ve
          tasted this snail caviar, milky pearlescent eggs that, once
          cleaned of any dirt, taste earthy and rich. Some friends have
          suggested snail farming specifically for caviar should be one of
          the aims of the project, but I don’t have the space or really the
          desire to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further layers of meaning accumulated as I realized the snails
          were storing physical records of their care and neglect within
          their shells. Analogous to geological strata or ice core samples,
          each shell offers a material archive containing potentially
          interpretable information about the state of contemporary art
          practice at large and the personal habits of myself as their
          caretaker. These habits have swung in the direction of neglect for
          extended periods. In 2021, while on an international tour as part
          of the Whistlegraph artist group, the snails survived in my studio
          for a month without care. But the evidence of my neglect was
          obvious and permanent for this population, with almost every
          still-developing snail exhibiting at least one growth line of
          neglect. Many snails have died, and I’ve taken care to preserve
          their shells. This has felt less important more recently–some of
          these shells have been used as painting supports in and of
          themselves, painted to resemble simple chameleon heads or in a
          monochrome brown. I’m confused by these snail-induced artworks,
          and feel that acknowledging them here may give them unwarranted
          attention. But this is a marathon, not a sprint, and these are the
          realities of the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          A brief image that explains my mindset during this time, roughly
          2020-2022. My primary focus was the daily practice with my
          collaborators in Whistlegraph, which pulled attention away from
          the snails. As a result of this new responsibility, the snails
          frequently took the backseat. A reoccuring dream during this time
          involved encountering vast towers of terrariums, dirty and
          stinking, abandoned for what seemed like years in awful, dark
          rooms. To my horror, as I’d peer into these terrariums, the small
          animals inside were somehow still, just barely, alive.
        </p>
        <h3>Alien Hybrid Monsters</h3>
        <p>
          Within the first year with the snails, the project projected a far
          horizon of biological speculation. I am nurturing the potential
          for genetic transformation through selective breeding and
          neglectful care, with the goal of hybridizing these snails with
          other mollusk species, particularly cephalopods like cuttlefish,
          aiming to produce a new, intelligent mosaic life form capable of
          novel forms of interspecies communication. Additions of other
          genetic materials, extraterrestrial or not, are welcome depending
          on what discoveries are made over the next million years. This is
          the farthest reaching vision for what this project could realize.
          Initially framed as an “ambient mutation tank”, casually
          irradiating the snails with ionizing waves from bananas and cosmic
          rays, I’ve doubled down on the project's mutative aims. During two
          public presentations of the snails at the San Francisco Art Book
          Fair and Decentralized Web Camp, the slow mutation of the lineage
          in my studio felt sufficiently teased out. But after these
          lectures, the hybridizing and creation of a novel animal became
          the focus of all changes within the genome I was nurturing. Around
          this period, the project resembled an unfundable analogue
          artificial intelligence startup with only a vague utility in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          This hybrid monster would exhibit a unique intelligence enabling
          communication in a novel way when measured against all current
          human to non-human communications. The evolutionary gap between
          vertebrates and invertebrates would be bridged through these
          charismatic new invertebrate representatives. I do believe in the
          creative transformation of life itself, not towards a Caligarian
          anthropomorphization of everything but towards a fundamental
          desire for an increase in difference and complexity. Not in the
          creation of, to use a contemporary example, a hyper-productive AI
          limited by our knowledge until it naturally escapes that, but a
          creation with that escape as the aim. An actively collaborative,
          mutualistic symbiosis. I may be too attached to the monstrous
          description, as I don’t imagine nor desire this species to be a
          disharmonic chimera.I prefer not to imprison this creature within
          the limits of my imagination. I’m trying to respect morphological
          designs I could never fully grasp in their emergence–to allow them
          to express themselves. When I use the term monster, I am borrowing
          that term to describe the products of a truly creative and
          courageous play with the materials of life itself. If the snails
          are to be this path towards creating a new form of life through
          contemporary methods, they will likely require the efforts and
          funds of multiple parties. But making the poetic case comes first.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          My lifetime with the snails will not coincide with the artwork the
          project seeks to realize. Even if that artwork is the alien hybrid
          monster, only over magaanums, if this lineage of snails remains
          unbroken through speciation or hybridization, would a point or
          points along this population’s evolutionary gradient become
          self-evident as an artwork. By this far future point, even within
          10,000 years, “art” may be an extinct term. Our own species will
          have transformed into something else. It becomes unimaginable,
          beyond speculation. But the most crucial qualities of art will
          surely persist, its extra-dimensional qualities perceptible by an
          audience we don’t have words to describe. Whatever it is that
          replaces art might ring at the same frequency we’ve come to
          associate with what’s best about art. I must stress that this
          recurring vision is as susceptible to transformation as the
          genetic information of the snails themselves during the life of
          this project. Had I written this a year or two ago, I would have
          insisted I had no clear agenda in sight. This project will exist
          for so long that it will outlive the many things I’ve thought
          about it over the years, including what I may think is its
          critical purchase in this text. Choosing a goal is as easy as
          writing it down, but more than anything just keeping these snails
          alive is what concerns me most. Another goal will likely reveal
          itself in time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m in my sixth year of breeding these snails over what is now
          surely the 13th 14th 15th 16th(?) generation. Their rapid
          reproduction means a few months of relative detachment from the
          project can confuse generation counting. There are still times I
          walk into my studio and expect them all to be dead. I am a
          terrible snail owner. There are periods of boredom with the
          project followed by focused observation and maintenance. The
          snails have moved between California, Oregon, and New York. When
          preparing to move them to New York, I decreased the population by
          tossing many of the snails in gardens and yards in my Los Angeles
          neighborhood as a sort of insurance in the event of a total
          die-off. I’d like to think that any snail I find in those yards
          contains some genetic continuity with the original lineage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Improvements can be made. By this point the rampant incest must
          be curtailed. I’m considering the introduction of one or two
          individuals from outside the project to increase genetic
          diversity. Simultaneously, forking off specifically selected
          couples in reproduction tanks would begin the process of selecting
          for specific traits. These traits need only to be determined for
          reasons somewhat arbitrary (shell color, shape, and pattern) or
          better suited for survival in the project (shell thickness, snail
          size). I’d like to provide the snails with more space in the
          coming years. Close quarters can decrease snail activity due to
          constant interaction with one another’s mucus trails. The plan is
          to design a circular dish about the size of a washing machine
          window or larger in which a mound of clay-abundant, sand-heavy
          soil and rock can be sculpted, with a breeding mote of softer
          substrate around the perimeter. A large acrylic cloche with a
          handle can be used to cover this mound.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, while extensive textual reflections and conceptual
          tangents remain secondary to the central breeding and care
          practice, they serve an essential role in maintaining the
          project's visibility and interest over potentially vast
          timescales. These written records may prove crucial in securing
          future engagement and funding, ensuring the project's continuity
          and its potential transformation across generations. There is a
          possibility of this.
